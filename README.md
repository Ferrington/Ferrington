### Hi there, I'm Christopher.

I currently work as a controls engineer and am passionate about software.

Lately you can find me working on Bug Wars [server](https://github.com/yuneKim/bug-wars-server)/[client](https://github.com/yuneKim/bug-wars-client) and a [Chat App](https://github.com/Ferrington/chat-app) project.

My current tech stack of choice is TypeScript, Vue.js, and Java Spring Boot.
